## Background

The main purpose of this library is to visualize a piece of given music. In real life, people use different music apps and adding such features can make the apps look fancier. Also, a visualizer can specifically make the listener see what note is being played and can make the creator of the music improve their song or enhance the listening experience of the listener. Also, a music visualizer used in different singing apps for social purposes can tell the user what key they should be singing next. It can also be used in communication apps like Skype or Messenger. Graphics can make the user feel more interacting with the user at the other end.
